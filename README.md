# Welcome to Sweet Spot!
The application which lets you share the world's best sweet spots to visit, and let other people know about them in the mean time. Up next, we will explain everything you need to know to use the application with ease, so let's get started!!


## Dashboard!

As soon as you enter the site, you'll be grated by a beautiful dashboard, which shows the only type of information this website is programmed to show: posts!! Hope you like them, 'cause there's really nothing else. In here you can add posts by clicking the '+' button at the bottom right corner, see specific details of each post by clicking on them and filter posts by typing the desired title in the filters text field. Not much more to explain here (It's a really basic app), so let's continue to adding your very own posts!

## Adding posts!

If you click the '+' button in the bottom right corner of the application, you'll be taken to a form which you can complete in order to share the world a new spot to visit. If you mess up, the reason why will not show, but as long as you stick to completing the fields with strings, you are good to go mate! You will be though, noticed that the post was not uploaded and taken back to the dashboard. If you, on the other hand, decide to fill the form with a title, a url link to the spot image, the exact coordinates and some comment about the place, you will be taken to the dashboard as wall, but this time feeling exited that you just shared your first (or 10th, idk) post! I'm really happy for you. Let's get moving to the posts details, not much more to go really.

## Post details!

Now, if you decided to click on a post shown in the dashboard, you'll be taken to the most complex and time consuming section of the hole application! In here, you can edit the posts (it's really the same form than the 'add post' one but disguised), remove the post (It can't be that bad, right?), check the place location in Google Maps by clicking on the image (it will pop up a modal, but it don't hurt, I promise) and not much more i guess (it did felt like it did more stuff though -\(T_T)/-)

## Ending!

And that's it folks! Though not extensive, it did help to learn some stuff and keep the mind running. Hope you enjoyed the app, and hope to hear from you in the future!!
